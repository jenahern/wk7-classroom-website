    <p>Our class has been taking wonderful care of Mr. B's pet hamster, Nibbles, while he has been out of town.</p>
    <p>In Science the class took a poll to see how they felt about have a classroom pet.</p><br>
    <img height="600 px" width="400 px" src="science class.jpg" /><h4>Overall, the class enjoyed having a pet, but it was some hard work</h4>
    <p>Then we took a vote to see what pet would be best for us.</p><br>

    <h4>The class has spoken!  A pet turtle will be joining the 2nd grade soon!</h4>
